	Dockerfiles

This repository contains the docker files that I use reguarly. Mostly,
they're for copying the servers at my uni so I don't have to constantly
SSH into the to check my code works on the server, not just my machine.
My aim is to make them as close as possible to drop in replacements. Also,
something that would be particuarly nice to have would be something like
hot reloading so I can develop locally and it gets replicated in the container.
For compiled languages it would also be nice for the code to be recompiler
but that can probably be handled by installing some sort of watcher.
